# Whale Data Visualiser

This software was created in collaboration with Dr Nicola Quick of Duke University.
It is designed to load files of accelerometer data from a module attached to a whale, and display the facing, depth, and velocity data, alongside a 3D indicator of the facing direction, to assist with visualisation of whale behaviours.
