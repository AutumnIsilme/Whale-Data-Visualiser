In my first iteration of marks, I overlooked the fact that you can set the first mark ahead of the second mark.
I corrected for setting the second mark before the first mark by moving the first mark back, but it was still
possible to get them in the wrong order. The algorithm I used is below:

if (Button("Set Mark 1"))
{
    mark_0 = temporal_index;
    x1[0] = mark_0;
    x1[1] = mark_0;
}
SameLine();
if (Button("Set Mark 2"))
{
    if (temporal_index < mark_0)
    {
        mark_0 = temporal_index;
        x1[0] = mark_0;
        x1[1] = mark_0;
    }
    mark_1 = temporal_index;
    x2[0] = mark_1;
    x2[1] = mark_1;
}

I had to do basically the same thing as in the mark 2 bit in mark 1 as well:

if (Button("Set Mark 1"))
{
    mark_0 = temporal_index;
    x1[0] = mark_0;
    x1[1] = mark_0;
}
SameLine();
if (Button("Set Mark 2"))
{
    if (temporal_index > mark_1)
    {
        mark_1 = temporal_index;
        x2[0] = mark_1;
        x2[1] = mark_1;
    }
    mark_0 = temporal_index;
    x1[0] = mark_0;
    x1[1] = mark_0;
}
