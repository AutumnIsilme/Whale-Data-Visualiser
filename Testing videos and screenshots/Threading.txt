I had the idea to use threading to speed up loading the filename type of cache.
Initially this didn't work, but I figured most of the reasons out before being stumped by the wrong data file being loaded for some graphs sometimes.
I eventually tracked this down to the fact that I free the filename before the thread starts if the timing is right.
This meant that the same bit of memory was used to store the filename and it ended up giving the wrong answer.
Therefore, I changed the code to copy the filename and pass the copy. I had already copied it for another reason, but I needed to actually pass the copy.

In terms of performance improvements, this brings down the time from around 0.6 seconds to around 0.3 seconds to load a filename cache.
